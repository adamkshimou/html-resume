<ul>
    <li>I'm an avid gym goer, working out between 4-5 times every week as physical and mental health are important for me.</li>
   <li>I am a proud member of ColorStack International which is a program designed to push Latino and Black students into kickstarting their tech careers. This group has weekly meetings and scheduled events all centered around careers in coding.</li>
    <li>Lastly on my free time I dedicate most of it to media creation as I dream of someday producing content that fairs helpful to people out there, may it be assist them in learning coding concepts or sharing my knowledge on other topics im deeply invested in such as <b>Myology(The Study of Muscles)</b></li>
